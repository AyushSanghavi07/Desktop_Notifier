##**TASK NO 1:- Desktop_Notifier**
Aim: Create a desktop notifier by using python

Theory:
Notification support people in remembering things. It is a little piece of text that appears on the desktop or mobile screen to inform the user about the updates or any other significant chunks of information. This information enables the user to focus on vital events and ignore the less significant ones. The notifications are stored in the notification bar, which we can refer to after completing the work.
